# RecipeBox
VERY basic recipe list

Added user authentication to v2, now you can create new users and login with said user. 
If you are logged in you can navigate to login/sign up until you've logged out.. if you try you will be redirected to landing page.
Set permissions so if you are admin you have free reign, if you are author you can add yourself as well as add recipes. If you are user then you can add recipe and view authors but not add yourself as author.
